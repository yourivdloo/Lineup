    <h1 class="header">Welcome to LineUp</h1>
    <p>LineUp is a web-based application which enlightens the work of amateur coaches. Coaches have a lot of responsibilities, like preparing trainings, creating lineups for matches, discussing tactics and even more. What if we could take one task away? The best option for this is creating a lineup for the match. If you want to use the LineUp application, you first need to log in. Once your logged in you can create a team and add players with their preference positions. Once you are done you can press generate formation and a formation will be automatically generated. The LineUp application uses algorithmics to try and fit every player on a suitable position. If you are not happy with the generated formation, it is possible to change the formation afterwards. I hope you found this useful and i wish you good times using the LineUp application.</p>
